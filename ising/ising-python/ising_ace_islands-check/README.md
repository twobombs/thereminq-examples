# ACE Ising Islands Check

This directory contains a collection of scripts for running and visualizing ACE Ising depth tests, with a focus on checking the "islands" of qubits.

## Subdirectories

*   **`graphs/`**: Contains a suite of Python scripts for visualizing the results of the simulations, including 2D and 3D heatmaps and line plots.
*   **`measurements/`**: This directory likely contains the log files and data generated by the simulation runs.

## Scripts

*   **Shell Scripts (`*.sh`)**: A collection of shell scripts for running the ACE Ising simulations with various parameters and configurations, including different patching strategies ("high" and "low" islands).
