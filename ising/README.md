# Ising Model Simulations

This directory contains a collection of simulations and experiments related to the Ising model, implemented in both Python and C/OpenCL.

## Subdirectories

*   **`ising-c/`**: Contains C and OpenCL source code for simulations of the 2D Ising model and the Transverse Field Ising Model (TFIM).
*   **`ising-python/`**: Contains Python-based simulations and visualizations of the Ising model, with a focus on the ACE backend.

## Overview

This directory provides a comprehensive set of tools for exploring the Ising model, from low-level C/OpenCL implementations to high-level Python scripts for analysis and visualization.
