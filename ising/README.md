# Ising Model Simulations

This directory contains a collection of simulations and experiments related to the Ising model, implemented in both Python and C/OpenCL.

## Subdirectories

*   **`ising-c/`**: Contains C and OpenCL source code for simulations of the 2D Ising model and the Transverse Field Ising Model (TFIM).
*   **`ising-python/`**: Contains Python-based simulations and visualizations of the Ising model, with a focus on the ACE backend.

# Ising Model Benchmarks
This directory contains a collection of benchmarks and experiments related to the Ising model, a fundamental model in statistical mechanics used to study ferromagnetism. The benchmarks cover a variety of platforms and implementations, including `PyQrackIsing`, `Quantinuum`, and a custom C/OpenCL implementation.


*   **`pyqrackising/`**: A collection of benchmarks and experiments for the `PyQrackIsing` library, covering a range of problems from Max-Cut and the Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP) to protein folding and factorization landscape discovery.
*   **`quantinuum/`**: A collection of benchmarks and experiments related to the Transverse Field Ising Model (TFIM), likely run on or for Quantinuum hardware.
*   **`tfim-qrack/`**: A collection of benchmarks and experiments for the Transverse Field Ising Model (TFIM) using the Qrack framework, including both OpenCL-accelerated quantum simulations and classical samplers.

## Files

*   **`ising-c`**: Subdirectory containing C/OpenCL implementations.
