# Transverse Field Ising Model (TFIM) Simulation and Visualization

This directory contains a suite of scripts for running and visualizing Transverse Field Ising Model (TFIM) simulations using the `PyQrackIsing` library. The core of this toolchain is a sophisticated graphical user interface (GUI) that allows for interactive exploration of the TFIM parameter space and visualization of the results in 3D.

## Scripts

### Core Simulation and UI

*   **`sqr_magnetisation-iterations_ui.py`**: The main application. This script launches a `tkinter`-based GUI control panel and a `vedo`-based 3D plotter in separate processes. The GUI allows you to:
    *   Run single simulations with custom parameters.
    *   Launch full scans of the J-h parameter plane.
    *   Run extended scans over Trotter steps (`t`) and the number of qubits (`n_qubits`).
    *   Import and visualize pre-computed simulation data from CSV files.
    *   "Salvage" data from log files, in case a simulation run was interrupted.
*   **`sqr_magnetisation-iterations_cli.py`**: A command-line interface (CLI) version of the simulation script. It accepts all the TFIM parameters as command-line arguments, making it suitable for batch processing and automated scans.
*   **`start_ui.sh`**: A convenience script that installs the necessary dependencies (`tkinter`, `vedo`, `pv`, `tqdm`, `basis-set-exchange`), and then launches the UI. It also includes an `ffmpeg` command to create a video from the PNG images generated by the UI.

### Benchmarking and Automation

*   **`sqr_magnetisation-iterations.py`**: A basic script for running a single TFIM simulation with hardcoded parameters. It serves as a simple example of how to use the `tfim_square_magnetization` function.
*   **`sqr_magnetisation-iterations.sh`**: A powerful and well-documented shell script for running large-scale TFIM simulations in parallel. It iterates over a vast parameter space, is resumable (it can skip already-completed simulations), and generates summary CSV files. This script is designed for serious benchmarking and data generation.

## How to Use

1.  **Run the UI**:
    ```bash
    bash start_ui.sh
    ```
    This will install the dependencies and launch the control panel and 3D plotter.

2.  **Generate Data (Optional)**:
    If you want to generate a large dataset of simulation results, you can use the `sqr_magnetisation-iterations.sh` script. **Warning**: This script can generate a massive amount of data and take a very long time to run. Be sure to configure the parameter ranges in the script before running it.

3.  **Visualize**:
    *   Use the sliders in the UI to run single simulations and see the results in real-time.
    *   Use the "Run Full Scan" button to generate a 3D surface plot of the J-h plane.
    *   Use the "Import All Directories" or "View All Directories" buttons to visualize pre-computed data from the `tfim_results_final` directory.

## Directory Structure

*   `!old/`: Contains older versions of the scripts.
*   `tfim_results_final/`: The default output directory for the CSV files generated by the `sqr_magnetisation-iterations.sh` script and the UI's "salvage" function.
*   `tfim_logs/`: The default output directory for the log files generated by the `sqr_magnetisation-iterations.sh` script.
