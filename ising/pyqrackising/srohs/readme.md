# Factorization Landscape Discovery

This directory contains a set of scripts for exploring the factorization landscape of integers using the `PyQrackIsing` library. The approach is based on the principles described in the arXiv papers [2301.06738](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.06738) and [2506.16799](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.16799). It's important to note that these scripts are designed to discover the landscape of the problem, rather than being a direct factorization algorithm.

## Scripts

### Core Logic

*   **`factorizing_wrapper.py`**: A Python script that takes an integer `N` as input and attempts to find its factors `p` and `q` by formulating the problem as a HUBO (Higher-Order Unconstrained Binary Optimization) problem, which is then converted to a QUBO and solved using a spin glass solver. The script can run on both CPU and GPU and is highly parallelized.
*   **`factorizing_wrapper.sh`**: A shell script that automates the process of running `factorizing_wrapper.py` for a range of numbers. It generates pairs of prime numbers, calculates their product, and then runs the factorization script with different quality settings in a "grand race" to find the solution.

### Visualization

*   **`factorizing_wrapper_graph.py`**: A `vedo`-based visualization script that parses the log files generated by `factorizing_wrapper.py`. It creates a 3D plot of the factorization landscape, with the `p` and `q` factors on the x and y axes, the quality setting on the z-axis, and the points colored by the "cost" of the solution.

### Older Version

*   **`PyQrackIsing795_or_less/`**: This directory contains an older version of the scripts, which uses a different HUBO formulation.

## How to Use

1.  **Run the Factorization Script**:
    *   You can run the `factorizing_wrapper.py` script directly, passing the number to factor and the quality setting as command-line arguments:
        ```bash
        python3 factorizing_wrapper.py 35 4
        ```
    *   Alternatively, you can use the `factorizing_wrapper.sh` script to run the factorization for a range of numbers.
2.  **Visualize the Landscape**:
    *   After running the factorization script, you can use `factorizing_wrapper_graph.py` to visualize the results:
        ```bash
        python3 factorizing_wrapper_graph.py
        ```
