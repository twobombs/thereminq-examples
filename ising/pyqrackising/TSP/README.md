# Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP) Solver Benchmarks and Visualizations

This directory contains a collection of Python scripts and shell utilities for benchmarking and visualizing solutions to the Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP) using the `PyQrackIsing` library.

### Core Solvers and Benchmarks

*   **`tsp.py`**: A script that solves the TSP for a randomly generated graph using the `tsp_symmetric` function from `PyQrackIsing`. It accepts various parameters via the command line to control the solving process.
*   **`tsp.sh`**: A shell script for running `tsp.py` in parallel with a wide range of parameters. It's designed for comprehensive benchmarking of the `tsp_symmetric` solver.
*   **`tsp_monte_carlo.py`**: A Monte Carlo version of the TSP solver. It runs multiple instances of the `tsp_symmetric` function in parallel and returns the best solution found.
*   **`tsp_monte_carlo.sh`**: A shell script for automating the execution of `tsp_monte_carlo.py` with various parameters.
*   **`pyqrackising_benchmark_iterations.py`**: A dedicated benchmark for the `tsp_symmetric` function. It generates clustered TSP instances, runs the solver, validates the solution, and records the performance.
*   **`pyqrackising_benchmark_iterations.sh`**: A shell script that automates the execution of `pyqrackising_benchmark_iterations.py` for a range of node sizes.

### Analysis and Visualization

*   **`parse_results_2d.py`**: A script that parses the `.txt` log files generated by the benchmark scripts, extracts the TSP experiment data, and creates a 2D line plot of the path length versus the number of nodes.
*   **`visualize_3d.py`**: A `PyVista`-based script that creates a stacked 3D visualization of the TSP solutions from the `tsp_*.txt` log files. It plots each path on a separate Z-level, allowing for a visual comparison of how the solutions change with the problem size.
*   **`visualize_3d_mc.py`**: Similar to `visualize_3d.py`, but this script is tailored to the output of the Monte Carlo TSP solver (`tspmontecarlo_*.txt` files).

### How to Use

1.  **Run Benchmarks**:
    *   Use the `tsp.sh`, `tsp_monte_carlo.sh`, or `pyqrackising_benchmark_iterations.sh` scripts to run the benchmarks. These will generate `.txt` log files in the `results` directory.
2.  **Analyze Results**:
    *   Run `python3 parse_results_2d.py` to generate a 2D plot of the results.
3.  **Visualize in 3D**:
    *   Run `python3 visualize_3d.py` or `python3 visualize_3d_mc.py` to create the stacked 3D visualizations.
