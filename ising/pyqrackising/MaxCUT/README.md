# Max-Cut Benchmarks and Visualizations

This directory contains a suite of Python scripts and shell utilities for benchmarking and visualizing Max-Cut problem solutions using the `PyQrackIsing` library.

### Scripts

*   **`maxcut_benchmarks.py`**: Benchmarks the `spin_glass_solver` on various types of randomly generated graphs (Erdos-Renyi, planted-partition, and d-regular bipartite). It measures performance and solution quality for different graph sizes and saves the results to a CSV file.
*   **`maxcut_benchmarks.sh`**: Automates running `maxcut_benchmarks.py` across a range of graph sizes, from 32 to 65536.
*   **`maxcut_random.py`**: A script designed for performance testing of the `spin_glass_solver` on random graphs. It includes command-line flags for controlling graph size, solution quality, and GPU usage.
*   **`maxcut_random.sh`**: A shell script that runs `maxcut_random.py` in parallel with different parameters, including with and without the `--is-alt-gpu` flag. It manages GPU resources and saves the output to log files.
*   **`maxcut_gpu_perf_viz.py`**: A visualization script that parses log files generated by the benchmark scripts. It creates 2D and 3D plots to compare the performance (solution time) and quality (cut weight) of runs with and without the `--is-alt-gpu` flag.
*   **`maxcut_quad_graph.py`**: A sophisticated visualization tool that uses `PyVista` to create interactive 3D renderings of the Max-Cut partitions. It reads log files, reconstructs the graph and the two sets of nodes (the partition), and displays them in a 3D space. It supports separate views for CPU and GPU results and can merge them for comparison.
*   **`maxcut_stereo_graph.py`**: Another `PyVista`-based visualization script that creates a side-by-side stereoscopic 3D view of the Max-Cut partitions. It also reads log files and reconstructs the graph to generate the visualization.

### Data

*   **`results.tar.gz`**: A compressed archive containing benchmark results.
