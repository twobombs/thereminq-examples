# Protein Folding Landscape Scanner

This directory contains an experimental protein folding landscape scanner that leverages `PyQrackIsing` to fold proteins of up to 200 amino acids in length. It includes scripts for running the simulations in both 2D and 3D, as well as advanced visualization tools.

## Scripts

### Core Solvers

*   **`protein_folding.py`**: A script for running 2D protein folding simulations. It takes a protein sequence as input, converts it to a Hydrophobic-Polar (HP) model, creates a QUBO, and then uses a spin glass solver to find the lowest energy conformation. The script is heavily optimized for parallel execution, distributing worker processes across multiple GPUs.
*   **`protein_folding3d.py`**: An extension of `protein_folding.py` that supports both 2D and 3D protein folding. It includes logic to create and decode QUBOs for both 2D and 3D models.
*   **`protein_folding.sh`**: A shell script that automates the process of running `protein_folding.py` for a list of proteins defined in `protein_folding.csv`.

### Data

*   **`protein_folding.csv`**: A CSV file containing a list of proteins, their lengths, and their amino acid sequences. This file is used by `protein_folding.sh` to run simulations for multiple proteins.

### Visualization

*   **`protein_folding_graph.py`**: A script that parses the log files generated by the protein folding scripts and creates a 2D plot comparing the CPU and GPU results for each quality level. The plots are sorted by energy, providing a clear visual comparison of the different solutions.
*   **`stacked_protein_folding_graph.py`**: A sophisticated 3D visualization tool that parses the log files and plots the conformations in a stacked 3D space. High-energy folds are rendered as thin and transparent, while low-energy folds are thick and opaque, creating a clear visual representation of the energy landscape.

## How to Use

1.  **Run Simulations**:
    *   Use the `protein_folding.sh` script to run the simulations for the proteins listed in `protein_folding.csv`. This will generate `.log` files in the current directory.
2.  **Visualize Results**:
    *   Run `python3 protein_folding_graph.py` to generate 2D plots comparing the CPU and GPU results.
    *   Run `python3 stacked_protein_folding_graph.py 'protein_folding_*.log'` to create an interactive 3D visualization of the folding landscape.
