## Abstract
Utilizing the ThereminQ ecosystem and the Qrack framework, we simulate a Transverse Field Ising Model (TFIM) across a unique cluster of four 100% boundary tri-hole manifolds wired in a $K_4$ complete graph geometry. By introducing a discrete Möbius half-twist at the inter-manifold junctions, we establish a robust framework for studying holonomy and loop-momentum spectra. Our approach resolves bond-level mean-field dynamics with injected stochastic variance, establishing classical multi-GPU systems as a primary tool for exploring intricate topological phases, preserving loop structures lost in traditional face-averaging, and providing actionable insights for scalable quantum research.

## 1. Introduction
The pursuit of fault-tolerant quantum computation is currently constrained by the limited coherence times and high error rates of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. In this regime, we propose a paradigm of "Classical Quantum Advantage": leveraging high-performance, GPU-accelerated classical hardware to reliably model highly entangled, multi-component topological quantum systems. This paper introduces the $K_4$ All-Boundary Manifold Cluster Annealing Engine, which maps a Transverse Field Ising Model (TFIM) onto a specialized, non-trivial topology using classical simulators.

The simulated system consists of 108 total qubits partitioned into four 27-qubit sub-volumes, forming a $K_4$ complete graph. These sub-volumes interact via bond-resolved, mean-field coupled junctions containing 54 unique junction qubits in total. By injecting stochastic variance (shot noise) to emulate quantum fluctuations, we construct a volumetric annealing engine capable of mapping phase transitions and topological defects with high fidelity. This methodology highlights the capacity of advanced classical simulation to precede and guide physical QPU development by uncovering fundamental topological behaviors.

## 2. Topological Architecture & Methods
The simulated geometry departs from standard crystalline lattices in favor of a specialized manifold cluster designed to maximize boundary effects. Each 27-qubit sub-volume forms a tri-hole manifold with no bulk qubits (a 100% boundary topology). The manifold features three degree-3 portal rims, each comprising 18 qubits (3 corner and 6 mid-edge qubits per intra-manifold edge). Every qubit is shared exactly between two portals, fulfilling the all-boundary condition.

The four manifolds are wired as a $K_4$ complete graph. Each manifold utilizes its three local edges to form a single connection (junction) to every other manifold, resulting in 6 total junctions. Because each junction shares 9 qubit pairs, the system couples $6 \times 9 = 54$ unique junction qubits.

A key innovation in this architecture is the inter-manifold coupling scheme. We employ bond-resolved mean-field exchange instead of conventional face-averaging. By preserving the individual Bloch vector interactions across each of the 9 qubit pairs per junction, the simulation maintains the complex loop structures required for topological measurement.

Furthermore, the junction gluing mapping can be topologically tuned. A trivial identity gluing connects corresponding qubits directly, whereas a "Möbius Twist" gluing applies an order-reversing operation (a discrete Möbius half-twist) within the corner and mid-edge blocks. Comparing the dynamics under these two distinct gluings provides a direct computational probe of the topological holonomy, manifesting as measurable shifts in the loop-mode spectrum.

## 3. Numerical Implementation
The core dynamics are governed by a continuous-time TFIM Hamiltonian, integrated using a Suzuki-Trotter expansion:
$$ H(t) = - \sum_{\langle i, j \rangle} J(t) \sigma_i^z \sigma_j^z - \sum_i h_x(t) \sigma_i^x - \sum_i h_z(t) \sigma_i^z $$
To evolve the system, the Hamiltonian is exponentiated into local discrete unitary gates. The classical simulation exploits a multi-GPU parallelization strategy via the Qrack framework. We allocate one worker process per GPU, dedicating each to a single 27-qubit manifold. This explicit partitioning restricts statevector memory to approximately 1 GB (fp32) per manifold, easily accommodated by VRAM allocation caps.

Stochastic noise, scaled proportionally to $\sqrt{\Delta t / N_{\text{shots}}}$, is injected at the boundaries to simulate the finite sampling statistics typical of projective quantum measurements. Crucially, mean-field coupling is implemented continuously; kick payloads persist across non-measurement steps to avoid integration inflation. As an engineering robustness mechanism, the software includes a Pauli code autodetect feature, ensuring consistent operator definitions and angle conventions dynamically across distinct hardware worker processes.

## 4. Diagnostics & Error Mitigation
The complex $K_4$ geometry provides intrinsic pathways for error detection and physical diagnostics. We introduce two primary mechanisms to analyze the topological states and mitigate numerical or simulated physical errors:

1. **Racetrack Loop DFT:** The Hamiltonian cycle spanning the manifolds (e.g., $0 \rightarrow 1 \rightarrow 2 \rightarrow 3 \rightarrow 0$) forms a 4-junction loop coordinate. At each measurement step, the per-junction mean Bloch vectors are transformed via a Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) over this coordinate. This yields loop-momentum amplitudes for discrete wavevectors $k = 0, 1, 2, 3$. While the $k=0$ uniform mode captures global magnetization, higher-$k$ overtones represent fundamental circulating modes. The Möbius holonomy splits the degeneracy of these modes, and any off-curve spectral weight serves as an indicator of dynamical error or decoherence.

2. **Swap Asymmetry Parity Check:** Under the Möbius paired gluing configuration (e.g., pairs $(0,1)$ and $(2,3)$), the ideal, noiseless ground state dynamics are symmetric under the exchange of the paired manifolds. The residual Root Mean Square (RMS) mismatch—or "Swap Asymmetry"—between these manifolds acts as a continuous, live parity check. Unlike temporal echoing which cancels reversible errors, this spatial swap asymmetry provides a pure error signal without requiring a known exact ground truth.

## 5. Conclusion
The $K_4$ All-Boundary Manifold Cluster Annealing Engine demonstrates the profound utility of Classical Quantum Advantage. By utilizing high-throughput, GPU-accelerated mean-field coupled statevectors, we successfully model the holonomy and boundary dynamics of highly complex topological geometries. The introduction of Möbius twist gluing, bond-resolved coupling, and novel spatial parity checks provides a rich set of tools for probing quantum phase transitions and topological defects. Until physical fault-tolerant QPUs achieve the requisite scale and coherence, such massively parallel classical architectures will remain indispensable for pioneering scalable, predictive research in topological quantum matter.
