# Quantum Error Correction (QEC)

This directory contains a shell script for running a quantum error correction (QEC) experiment using the Mitiq library.

## Files

*   **`mitiq-run.sh`**: A shell script that runs a Python script named `mitiq_repetition_code.py` (located elsewhere in the repository). The name of the script suggests that it implements a repetition code for quantum error correction and uses the Mitiq library to perform error mitigation.
