# HHL Algorithm Implementation

This directory contains a Python script for implementing the Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (HHL) algorithm using Qiskit. The HHL algorithm is a quantum algorithm for solving systems of linear equations.

## Files

*   **`hhl.py`**: A Python script that demonstrates the use of Qiskit's `HHL` class to solve a simple 2x2 system of linear equations. The script defines the problem, instantiates the HHL solver, solves the system, and then compares the result to the exact classical solution.

## Overview

The `hhl.py` script serves as a clear and well-commented example of how to use the HHL algorithm in Qiskit. It also includes a discussion on the benefits of using 1-bit Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) to reduce the resource requirements of the algorithm.

The mention of a CERN/NikHEF HHL effort in the original `readme.md` suggests that this implementation may be a starting point for or a reference to a larger research project.
