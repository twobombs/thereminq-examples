# Variational Quantum Linear Solver (VQLS)

This directory contains a Python script that implements the Variational Quantum Linear Solver (VQLS) algorithm using Qiskit. The script was generated by Gemini 2.5 after being given the PDF file `1731241185612.pdf`.

## Files

*   **`vqls.py`**: A Qiskit-based implementation of the VQLS algorithm. It defines a simple 8x8 linear system of equations, and then uses the `VQLS` class from `qiskit_algorithms` to solve it. The script uses a `RealAmplitudes` ansatz and the `SPSA` optimizer. It then compares the solution from the VQLS algorithm to the exact classical solution and calculates the fidelity.
*   **`1731241185612.pdf`**: The research paper that was used as the source material for generating the `vqls.py` script.

## Overview

This directory provides a fascinating example of AI-powered code generation. The `vqls.py` script is a clear and well-commented implementation of the VQLS algorithm, and it serves as a great starting point for anyone interested in learning more about this important quantum algorithm.
