# Peaked: Discovery

This directory contains visualization tools for exploring the structure of quantum circuits, specifically focused on "extreme" scaling layouts to visualize large or complex circuits.

## Files

- **`qpe.qasm`**: A QASM file used for testing the visualization scripts.
- **`qpetensorvizphyz.py`**: The primary visualization script. It loads a circuit tensor (generated by a parser like `qpetensor.py` from the `solver_1` or similar), builds a DAG representation, and renders an interactive 3D visualization using `vedo` and `networkx`. It features an "extreme" layout where time is compressed and width is expanded, useful for wide circuits.
- **`qpetensorvizphyztagged.py`**: A variation of the visualization script, likely featuring additional tagging or highlighting logic for specific gates or qubits.
- **`qpetensorviztube.py`**: Another variation of the visualization script, possibly employing a tube-like 3D layout or specific rendering style for the circuit connections.
