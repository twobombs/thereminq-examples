# Peaked: Discovery

This directory contains visualization tools for exploring the structure of quantum circuits, specifically focused on "extreme" scaling layouts to visualize large or complex circuits. These tools expect circuit tensors as input (likely `circuit_tensor.pt`), which are typically generated by scripts in other directories (e.g., `peaked/solvers/`).

## Files

- **`qpe.qasm`**: A QASM file used for testing the visualization scripts.
- **`qpetensorvizphyz.py`**: The primary visualization script. It loads a circuit tensor, builds a DAG representation using `networkx`, and renders an interactive 3D visualization using `vedo`. It features an "extreme" layout where time is compressed and width is expanded, effectively visualizing wide circuits by using a force-directed layout for the y-z plane (qubit arrangement) while extending time along the x-axis.
- **`qpetensorvizphyztagged.py`**: A variation of the visualization script ("Physics Layout + Rank Heatmap") that adds interaction analysis. It colors gates and wires based on the "rank" of the qubit interaction frequency (using a rainbow spectrum) to highlight "hot" qubits. It also includes labels for qubits and a legend for the heatmap.
- **`qpetensorviztube.py`**: A "Dark Mode" variation of the visualization script designed for cleaner aesthetics. It renders gates as spheres and wires as colored lines (fading from start to end), with specific colors mapped to gate types (Input, Output, X, H, Phase, CX, SWAP). It includes a manual legend and interaction controls for panning (Right-Click Drag) and screenshots ('s').
