# Peaked: QASM to 3D Tensor Visualization

This project converts QASM quantum circuits into PyTorch tensors and renders them as interactive 3D structures.

## Key Files
- **`qpetensor.py`**: Parses QASM into a structural PyTorch tensor.
- **`qpetensorviz*.py`**: Various scripts for 3D visualization of the circuit tensor using `vedo` and `networkx`, featuring different layouts (physics-based, dark mode, extreme scale) and interaction heatmaps.
