# Holographic Ingestion Check

This tool simulates a "Holographic Ingestion" process and subsequent "Bulk Reconstruction" using the Weed tensor library. It demonstrates encoding data into a high-dimensional Hilbert space boundary state and performing inference via tensor contraction.

## Description

The `holographic_ingest_check.cpp` file performs the following steps:

1.  **Phase 1: Holographic Ingestion**
    -   Ingests a data stream (simulated) and maps features to a boundary index in a $2^{24}$ dimensional Hilbert space.
    -   Accumulates these mappings into a raw boundary data vector.
    -   Freezes the state into a `Weed::Tensor` (shared pointer).

2.  **Phase 2: Bulk Reconstruction (Inference)**
    -   Defines a bulk operator targeting a specific region.
    -   Contracts the boundary state tensor with the bulk operator tensor.
    -   Measures the overlap amplitude to verify if data exists in the target region.

## Compilation

To compile the code, use the provided `compile.sh` script:

```bash
./compile.sh
```

**Note:** This code depends on the `Weed` library and `OpenCL`. Ensure that the `Weed` headers (`shared_api.hpp`, `tensors/tensor.hpp`, etc.) are in your include path (e.g., `./include` or `./build/include/common`) and that `libweed` and `libOpenCL` are available.

## Expected Output

When run successfully, the program outputs the progress of ingestion and the result of the inference:

```
--- Phase 1: Holographic Ingestion ---
Ingesting Data Stream...
Mapped first row to index: ...
Freezing State into Weed Tensor...
Ingestion Complete. Boundary Size: 2^24

--- Phase 2: Bulk Reconstruction (Inference) ---
Applying Operator (Contracting Tensor Network)...
Reading Result State...
Inference Result (Overlap Amplitude): ...
>> CONCLUSION: Hypothesis CONFIRMED. (Data found in target region)
```

# Holographic Ingestion (Streaming)

The `holographic_ingest.cpp` tool extends the functionality to support streaming data ingestion. It handles large datasets by accumulating state counts in a sparse map before freezing them into a dense `Weed::Tensor`.

## Description (`holographic_ingest.cpp`)

1.  **Phase 1: Holographic Ingestion (Streaming Mode)**
    -   **Streaming Input:** Reads from a CSV file or generates a synthetic stream with a spiral drift pattern if no file is provided.
    -   **Sparse Accumulation:** Uses a `std::map` to efficiently count state occurrences in the $2^{24}$ dimensional Hilbert space, allowing for handling sparse data without allocating the full dense tensor immediately.
    -   **Hologram Export:** Exports the accumulated boundary state to `hologram_vis.csv` for visualization.
    -   **Tensor Freezing:** Converts the accumulated sparse map into a dense `Weed::Tensor` (shared pointer) for further processing.

2.  **Phase 2: Bulk Reconstruction**
    -   **Bulk Operator:** Defines a bulk operator targeting a specific region (index 27 and neighbors).
    -   **Tensor Contraction:** Performs element-wise multiplication (`*`) between the boundary state tensor and the bulk operator tensor.
    -   **Inference:** Measures the overlap at the target index to verify the hypothesis.

## Usage

To compile, use the updated `compile.sh` script:

```bash
./compile.sh
```

To run in demo mode (simulated stream):

```bash
./holographic_ingest
```

To run with a data file:

```bash
./holographic_ingest <data.csv>
```

# Holographic Visualization

The `holographic_ingest.py` script provides a way to visualize the holographic boundary state generated by the streaming ingestion tool.

## Description (`holographic_ingest.py`)

-   Reads the `hologram_vis.csv` file exported by `holographic_ingest`.
-   Plots the boundary state density (amplitude) as a scatter plot using `matplotlib`.
-   Maps the 1D Hilbert space index back to approximate 2D coordinates for visualization.

## Usage

Ensure you have the required Python libraries installed:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib
```

Run the visualization script after running `holographic_ingest`:

```bash
python3 holographic_ingest.py
```
