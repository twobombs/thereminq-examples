# Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA)

This directory contains a Python script for implementing the ADAPT-QAOA algorithm for solving the Max-Cut problem.

## Files

*   **`maxcut-qaoa-gpt.py`**: A comprehensive implementation of the ADAPT-QAOA algorithm. The script includes functions for constructing the necessary operators, building the ansatz, calculating gradients, running the optimization, and visualizing the results.

## Overview

The `maxcut-qaoa-gpt.py` script provides a clear and well-structured implementation of the ADAPT-QAOA algorithm, an advanced variant of the standard QAOA. The "ADAPT" part of the name refers to the adaptive selection of mixer operators at each layer of the ansatz, which can lead to more efficient and accurate solutions. This script is a powerful tool for exploring the performance of ADAPT-QAOA on the Max-Cut problem.
