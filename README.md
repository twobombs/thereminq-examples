## Repository Documentation

This repository is a collection of experimental configurations and development examples on the ThereminQ platform. Below is a summary of the main directories and their contents.

### `agentics`

This directory contains a Python script (`gemini-query.py`) for interacting with the Gemini API. This script is designed to be used within the `thereminq-tensor` containers.

### `benchmarks`

This directory holds various benchmarking scripts and results.

*   **`benchmarks/ising`**: Contains benchmarks related to the Ising model, a mathematical model of ferromagnetism. It has subdirectories for different implementations and platforms like `pyqrackising`, `quantinuum`, and `tfim-qrack`.
*   **`benchmarks/ising/pyqrackising`**: This directory contains several sub-projects related to the Ising model using `pyqrack`:
    *   `TFIM-base`: Provides a UI and visualization for the Transverse Field Ising Model (TFIM).
    *   `folding`: An experimental protein folding landscape scanner.
    *   `srohs`: A factorization landscape discovery script.

### `graphs`

This directory contains various graphs and visualizations generated by the ThereminQ platform.

### `hhl`

This directory contains experimental code related to the Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (HHL) algorithm, likely for solving linear systems of equations.

### `ising`

This directory contains various implementations and experiments related to the Ising model, including Python scripts and notebooks.

### `positron`

This directory contains an experiment related to simulating anti-qubits in a quantum circuit, inspired by the movie "Tenet".

### `qhrf`

This directory contains preliminary, highly experimental code for Quantum Harmonic Resonance Frequency (QHRF).

### `qvml`

This directory contains a small demo of Quantum Variational Machine Learning (QVML).

### `qwscatter`

This directory contains a large 3D scatter plot visualization.

### `vqe`

This directory contains diverse implementations of Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) examples.

### `vqe-qml`

This directory contains experimental code for using VQE with Quantum Machine Learning (QML) on Hermitian matrices.

### `vqls`

This directory contains an experiment using Gemini 2.5 to generate Qiskit code from a PDF for the Variational Quantum Linear Solver (VQLS) algorithm.
