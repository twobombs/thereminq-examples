# Quantum Walk Scatter

This directory contains Python scripts for simulating and visualizing 1D and 2D quantum walks.

## Scripts

*   **`qwscatter.py`**: A Qiskit-based simulation of a one-dimensional quantum walk with a barrier. It uses the `AerSimulator` to simulate the circuit and then plots the final probability distribution of the walker's position.
*   **`qwscatter-3d.py`**: A Qiskit-based simulation of a two-dimensional quantum walk on a 64x64 grid. It uses `matplotlib` to create a 3D animated visualization of the probability distribution over time.
*   **`qwscatter-large-qrack-multi.py`**: A PyQrack-based implementation of the 2D quantum walk simulation. It's optimized for performance and can handle larger simulations than the Qiskit-based version.

## Overview

The scripts in this directory provide a set of tools for exploring the behavior of quantum walks in one and two dimensions. The visualizations generated by these scripts provide a clear and intuitive way to understand the dynamics of quantum walks, including the effects of interference and the presence of barriers.
