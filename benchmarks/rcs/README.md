# Random Circuit Sampling (RCS) Benchmarks

This directory contains benchmarks related to Random Circuit Sampling (RCS), a task that is believed to be computationally difficult for classical computers.

## Files

*   **`run-sycamore-patch-quadrant-time`**: A shell script that runs the `sycamore_2019_patch_quadrant_time.py` script (located in the parent `rcs` directory) with a nested loop of parameters. It is used to benchmark the performance of the Sycamore patch quadrant simulation.
*   **`2024_willow_patch_quadrant_time_all.csv`**: A CSV file containing the results of the benchmark runs.
