# PyQrackIsing Benchmarks

This directory contains a collection of benchmarks and experiments for the `PyQrackIsing` library, covering a range of problems from Max-Cut and the Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP) to protein folding and factorization landscape discovery.

## Subdirectories

*   **`MaxCUT/`**: A suite of scripts for benchmarking and visualizing Max-Cut problem solutions.
*   **`TFIM-base/`**: A sophisticated graphical user interface (GUI) and a set of scripts for running and visualizing Transverse Field Ising Model (TFIM) simulations.
*   **`TSP/`**: A collection of scripts for benchmarking and visualizing solutions to the Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP).
*   **`folding/`**: An experimental protein folding landscape scanner that can fold proteins of up to 200 amino acids in length in both 2D and 3D.
*   **`srohs/`**: A set of scripts for exploring the factorization landscape of integers.
